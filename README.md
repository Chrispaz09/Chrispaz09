<Welcome to my corner of the codiverse!💥> 
I'm Christian and let me start off by telling you a little bit about who I am. 
I see myself as the one and probably not the only ohhh so eccentric coder 🐱‍🏍
I do have a unique presence and I try to let my code to reflect. Come and see for yourself! 👀✨

I do work as a software developer full time but it doesn't stop there for me. My vision is to allow my creativity 
to flow through my coding and create new ideas not just in my job but in every snippet of code I write. That's all for now!
